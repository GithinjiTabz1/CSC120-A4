- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?

At first, encapsulation seemed like a simple concept when approached theoretically. However, during the assignment, I realized how methods and variables, even if they belong to different classes, can deeply influence each other. Seeing how small, isolated elements can connect and form something more complex was really fascinating.


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Starting the assignment early was key for me.

 It gave me ample time to understand the material and troubleshoot issues. Whenever I got stuck, I would take breaks or sleep on it, and then seek help the next day, which really helped with managing frustration. Collaborating with other students and attending TA hours were also incredibly helpful in clarifying doubts.
 
  My advice to future students would be to give themselves time to process and not hesitate to ask for help when needed.
